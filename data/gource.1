\fBpath\fR
Either a Git directory, a pre-generated log file (see -\-git\-log\-command, -\-cvs\-exp\-command or the custom log format) or '-' to read STDIN. If path is ommited \fIgource\fR will attempt to read a git log from the current directory.
.SH GIT EXAMPLES

View the log of the Git respository in the current path:

.ti 10
\fIgource\fR

View the log of a Git project in the specified directory:

.ti 10
\fIgource\fR my\-project\-dir

Save a copy of the log using in a special git-log format and play it back. Use \-\-git-log-command to get the git-log options you should use:

.ti 10
cd my\-git\-project
.ti 10
\`\fIgource\fR \-\-git\-log\-command\` > my\-git\-project.log
.ti 10
\fIgource\fR my\-git\-project.log

NOTE: \-\-git-log-command assumes you have a recent version of git that supports all the options. You may need to modify the command line to work with an older version (changing %aN to %an for instance).

.SH CVS SUPPORT

You can view CVS projects with gource using the tool cvs-exp (not provided) with the command line specified by the -\-cvs\-exp\-command option:

.ti 10
cd my\-cvs\-project
.ti 10
\`\fIgource\fR \-\-cvs\-exp\-command\` > my\-cvs\-project.log
.ti 10
\fIgource\fR my\-cvs\-project.log

.SH SVN SUPPORT VIA GIT

SVN is not supported directly, however if your SVN repository has the standard three directories (trunk/, tags/ and branches/)
then you can try it in gource by importing it into a Git respository using the 'git svn' command:

.ti 10
svn checkout https://myrepo.example.org/svn my\-repo.git
.ti 10
git svn init \-\-stdlayout https://myrepo.example.org/svn my\-repo.git
.ti 10
cd my\-repo.git
.ti 10
git svn fetch

Note that the last command (git svn fetch) can take hours if your repository is large.

You can update this Git version of your SVN repository at any time using the following command:

.ti 10
git svn rebase

If your repository does not have the standard directories, please check out the git\-svn manpage (git help svn) for
information on how to modify the init line to meet your needs.

.SH CUSTOM LOG FORMAT

If you want to use Gource with something other than Git or CVS, there is a pipe delimited custom log format:

.ti 10
timestamp - A unix timestamp of when the update occured.
.ti 10
username  - The name of the user who made the update.
.ti 10
type      - Single character for the update type - (A)dded, (M)odified or (D)eleted.
.ti 10
file      - Path of the file updated.
.ti 10
colour    - A colour for the file in hex (FFFFFF) format. Optional.

.SH INTERFACE
The time shown in the top left of the screen is set initially from the first log entry read and is incremented according to the simulation speed (\-\-seconds\-per\-day).

Pressing SPACE at any time will pause/unpause the simulation. While paused you may use the mouse to inspect the detail of individual files and users.

TAB cycles through selecting the current visible users.

The camera mode, either tracking activity, or showing the entire code tree, can be toggled using the V key.

Interactive keyboard commands:
.sp
.ti 10
(V)   Toggle camera mode
.ti 10
(C)   Displays Gource logo
.ti 10
(N)   Jump forward in time to next log entry.
.ti 10
(+)   Increase simulation speed.
.ti 10
(-)   Decrease simulation speed.
.ti 10
(TAB) Cycle through visible users
.ti 10
(ESC) Quit
