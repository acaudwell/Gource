This file is to help you configure, build and install Gource for your system.

1. Dependencies
===============

Gource requires the following libraries to compile:

    SDL 1.2 (libsdl1.2-dev)
    SDL Image 1.2 (libsdl-image1.2-dev)
    PCRE3 (libpcre3-dev)
    FTGL 2.1.3~rc5-2 (libftgl-dev)
    PNG library (libpng12-dev)
    JPEG library (libjpeg62-dev)

2. Building
===========

Building on Linux/Mac OS:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

If you got the source directly from the Gource.git repository, you will first need to run:

    autoreconf -f -i

To generate the configure script.

Building on Windows:

On Windows I recommend compiling the project file gource.win32.cbp
for the Code Blocks IDE (www.codeblocks.org).

A pre-built version for Windows is normally available from the homepage.

3. Configure Options
====================

By default Gource will install some GNU FreeFont TTF Fonts on your system. If you already have
these fonts installed, you can configure Gource to use these instead:

    ./configure --enable-ttf-font-dir=/path/to/freefont/
