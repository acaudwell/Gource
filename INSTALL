This file is to help you configure, build and install Gource for your system.

1. Dependencies
===============

Gource requires the following libraries to compile (package names may vary):

    SDL 1.2 (libsdl1.2-dev)
    SDL Image 1.2 (libsdl-image1.2-dev)
    PCRE3 (libpcre3-dev)
    Freetype 2 (libfreetype6-dev)
    GLEW (libglew-dev)
    GLM (libglm-dev) >= 0.9.3
    Boost Filesystem >= 1.46 (libboost-filesystem-dev)

Optional:

   TinyXML (libtinyxml-dev)

SDL Image needs to have been built with support PNG and JPEG images.

GLM is a header only library that you can get from http://glm.g-truc.net/ if your distribution does not include it.

2. Building
===========

If you got the source directly from the Gource.git repository, you will first
need to run autogen.sh which will generate the configure script and
initialize and update the submodules.

    ./autogen.sh

Generic build instructions for Linux/Mac OS:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

Building on Windows:

On Windows I recommend compiling the project file gource.win32.cbp
for the Code Blocks IDE (www.codeblocks.org).

A pre-built version for Windows is normally available from the homepage.

Gource expects SDL to have been built with the NO_STDIO_REDIRECT flag.

3. Configure Options
====================

By default Gource will install some GNU FreeFont TTF Fonts on your system.

If you already have these fonts, you can configure Gource to use them with:

    ./configure --enable-ttf-font-dir=/path/to/freefont/

Gource includes a copy of the TinyXML library. To make Gource build against
the system library of TinyXML use:

    ./configure --with-tinyxml
