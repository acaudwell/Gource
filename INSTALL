This file is to help you configure, build and install Gource for your system.

1. Dependencies
===============

Gource requires the following libraries to compile (package names may vary):

    SDL 1.2 (libsdl1.2-dev)
    SDL Image 1.2 (libsdl-image1.2-dev)
    PCRE3 (libpcre3-dev)
    Freetype 2 (libfreetype6-dev)
    GLEW (libglew-dev)
    GLM (libglm-dev)
    Boost Filesystem >= 1.46 (libboost-filesystem-dev)

Optional:

   TinyXML (libtinyxml-dev)

Note: SDL Image needs to have been built with support PNG and JPEG images.

2. Building
===========

If you got the source directly from the Gource.git repository, you will first
need to run autoreconf to generate the configure script:

    autoreconf -f -i

You also need to initialize and update the submodules:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Building on Linux/Mac OS:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

    for Arch Linux, there is a gource-git pkgbuild available in the arch user repository: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=56547

Building on Windows:

On Windows I recommend compiling the project file gource.win32.cbp
for the Code Blocks IDE (www.codeblocks.org).

A pre-built version for Windows is normally available from the homepage.

3. Configure Options
====================

By default Gource will install some GNU FreeFont TTF Fonts on your system.

If you already have these fonts, you can configure Gource to use them with:

    ./configure --enable-ttf-font-dir=/path/to/freefont/

Gource includes a copy of the TinyXML library. To make Gource build against
the system library of TinyXML use:

    ./configure --with-tinyxml
