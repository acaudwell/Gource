1. Description
==============

OpenGL-based 3D visualisation tool for source control repositories.

The repository is displayed as a tree where the root of the repository is the
centre, directories are branches and files are leaves. Contributors to the
source code appear and disappear as they contribute to specific files and
directories.

2. Requirements
===============

Gource's display is rendered using OpenGL and requires a 3D accelerated video
card to run.

3. Using Gource
===============

gource <options> <path>

options:

    -h, --help
            Help ('-H' for extended help).

    -WIDTHxHEIGHT, --viewport WIDTHxHEIGHT
            Set the viewport size. If -f is also supplied, will attempt to set
            the video mode to this also. Add ! to make the window non-resizable.

    --screen SCREEN
            Set the number of the screen to display on.

    --window-position XxY
            Initial window position on your desktop which may be made up of
            multiple monitors.

            This will override the screen setting so don't specify both.

    --frameless
            Frameless window.

    -f, --fullscreen
            Fullscreen.

    -w, --windowed

    --start-date "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss +tz"
            Start with the first entry after the supplied date and optional time.

            If a time zone offset isn't specified the local time zone is used.

    --path PATH

    path    Either a supported version control directory, a pre-generated log
            file (see log commands or the custom log format), a Gource conf
            file or '-' to read STDIN.

            If path is omitted, gource will attempt to read a log from the
            current directory.

Git, Bazaar, Mercurial and SVN Examples:

View the log of the repository in the current path:

    gource

View the log of a project in the specified directory:

    gource my-project-dir

For large projects, generating a log of the project history may take a long
time. For centralized VCS like SVN, generating the log may also put load on
the central VCS server.

In these cases, you may like to save a copy of the log for later use.

You can generate a log in the VCS specific log format using
the --log-command VCS option:

    cd my-svn-project
    `gource --log-command svn` > my-svn-project.log
    gource my-svn-project.log

You can also have Gource write a copy of the log file in its own format:

    gource --output-custom-log my-project-custom.log

CVS Support:

Use 'cvs2cl' to generate the log and then pass it to Gource:

    cvs2cl --chrono --stdout --xml -g-q > my-cvs-project.log
    gource my-cvs-project.log

Custom Log Format:

If you want to use Gource with something other than the supported systems,
there is a pipe ('|') delimited custom log format:

    timestamp - A unix timestamp of when the update occured.
    username  - The name of the user who made the update.
    type      - initial for the update type - (A)dded, (M)odified or (D)eleted.
    file      - Path of the file updated.
    colour    - A colour for the file in hex (FFFFFF) format. Optional.

Caption Log Format:

Gource can display captions along the timeline by specifying a caption file
(using --caption-file) in the pipe ('|') delimited format below:

    timestamp - A unix timestamp of when to display the caption.
    caption   - The caption

Recording Videos:

See the guide on the homepage for examples of recording videos with Gource:

    https://github.com/acaudwell/Gource/wiki/Videos

Interface:

The time shown in the top left of the screen is set initially from the first
log entry read and is incremented according to the simulation speed
(--seconds-per-day).

Pressing SPACE at any time will pause/resume the simulation. While paused you
may use the mouse to inspect the detail of individual files and users.

TAB cycles through selecting the current visible users.

The camera mode, either tracking activity or showing the entire code tree, can
be toggled using the Middle mouse button.

You can drag the left mouse button to manually control the camera. The right
mouse button rotates the view.

Interactive keyboard commands:

    (V)   Toggle camera mode
    (C)   Displays Gource logo
    (K)   Toggle file extension key
    (M)   Toggle mouse visibility
    (N)   Jump forward in time to next log entry
    (S)   Randomize colours
    (D)   Toggle directory name display mode
    (F)   Toggle file name display mode
    (U)   Toggle user name display mode
    (G)   Toggle display of users
    (T)   Toggle display of directory tree edges
    (R)   Toggle display of root directory edges
    (+-)  Adjust simulation speed
    (<>)  Adjust time scale
    (TAB) Cycle through visible users
    (F12) Screenshot
    (Alt+Enter) Fullscreen toggle
    (ESC) Quit
